## Part V: Testable Design

- Testable Design (20 points)
  - First, describe some aspects and goals for what makes a testable design (20%)
  - Find an example in the code of an implementation that would make a certain kind of testing difficult or impossible. Document that code in your report and describe what would be prevented with that code. Describe how you would advise to fix that code. Implement a new version of that code with the newer design. (This can be as a dummy method that does not break the existing code). (40%)
  - Write a test case that executes the new, more testable code in a way that tests the newly testable functionality. (40%)
- Mocking (20 points)
  - Describe mocking and its utility. (20%)
  - Find a feature that could be mocked (that is not already) and would be good to be tested with mocking. Document this feature and how mocking would allow for a type of behavior checking not afforded without mocking. (40%)
  - Write a test case using Mockito that uses mocking to test that feature. (40%)
